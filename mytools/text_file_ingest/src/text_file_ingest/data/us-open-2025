Amanda Anisimova says she rewatched her heavy Wimbledon final defeat by Iga Swiatek to inspire her to "the most meaningful victory of my life" over the second seed in the US Open quarter-finals.

Fifty-three days ago, Poland's Swiatek demolished Anisimova 6-0 6-0 to win the title in a one-sided showpiece at SW19.

But the American showed her true capabilities with a 6-4 6-3 victory in a high-quality match in New York.

Eighth seed Anisimova said she watched the final back for the first time the night before their Flushing Meadows match-up.

"I watched them [highlights] back, as painful as it was, just to see what I can avoid or what went wrong," she said.

"Then after I had to watch some good highlights to remove that from my brain!"

It was something Anisimova may not have done after previous tough losses.

But since taking a break from the sport to protect her mental health, Anisimova's attitude towards setbacks on the court has changed.

"I feel like I was able to bounce back from it [Wimbledon defeat] really quickly. Maybe a few years ago I wouldn't have done as well as I have this time," the 24-year-old said.

"I would have maybe blamed myself more or held on to the guilt for longer.

"I made a point to myself, and also maybe to other people, that if you really put a positive mindset out there then you can have a positive outcome."

Anisimova will face four-time major champion Naomi Osaka in the semi-finals, after she beat 11th seed Karolina Muchova.
